The work involves creating professional-grade documentation tools that comply with German legal frameworks (SGB IX, ICF codes, Pflegegrad classifications) and incorporate detailed cost structures including employer social contributions. Max demonstrates deep expertise in German social service systems and seeks to transform complex template structures into practical, interactive tools that can improve calculation accuracy, increase application success rates, and reduce processing time. The ultimate goal is creating operational tools rather than basic documentation, with emphasis on systematic quality control and professional service delivery optimization.\n\n**Current state**\n\nMax is actively working with multiple template structures of varying complexity: an 18-point template (insufficient coverage), a 24-point template (comprehensive but potentially too detailed), and a \"mega-template\" spanning approximately 180-220 pages with 24 detailed blocks. The current focus is on transforming the mega-template into a fully interactive format without losing any information or data points. Max has an existing \"dynamic planner HTML\" file in the project and is working to integrate the mega-template data into this HTML format to create a comprehensive form-like structure that functions as an expandable questionnaire, allowing users to fill in responses and print results.\n\n**On the horizon**\n\nMax is planning to create a complete interactive system that opens in catalog-like sections, preserving all existing template points while providing fillable interfaces for data entry and output generation. The development involves integrating CSV data containing detailed professional service planning information into the HTML structure to make it more functional as a comprehensive planning tool.\n\n**Key learnings & principles**\n\nThrough iterative development, Max has identified that minimal templates can cover significant functionality while dramatically reducing completion time - an 8-point structure can provide approximately 85% of functionality while reducing completion time from 1-2 days to 2-3 hours. However, this approach requires careful attention to critical gaps including quality control systems, specificity for different types of limitations, detailed cost modeling, and coordination with other services. The work has revealed that template systems benefit from multi-level response capabilities, ranging from one-sentence elevator pitches to full detailed implementations, and that 95% topic coverage can be maintained while eliminating redundancy through proper structural organization.\n\n**Approach & patterns**\n\nMax follows a systematic verification and iterative improvement approach, preferring thorough analysis over quick solutions. The methodology involves identifying critical gaps through detailed comparison analysis, incorporating missing elements systematically, and then verifying results against comprehensive standards. Max works with complex technical specifications including ICF codes, SGB legal references, detailed financial calculations, and modular architecture designs.
