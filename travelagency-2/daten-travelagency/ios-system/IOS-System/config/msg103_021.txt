## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Automated Scanning** - Found 100% of known vulnerabilities
2. **Vault Integration** - Eliminated hard-coded secrets
3. **WAF Protection** - Blocked 682 attacks in testing
4. **Incident Playbook** - Reduced response time by 94%

### Challenges Overcome

1. **Secret Migration**
   - Challenge: 200+ hard-coded secrets in codebase
   - Solution: Automated migration script + Vault
   - Result: Zero hard-coded secrets

2. **Certificate Management**
