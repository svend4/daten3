**Why Vector Search?**

Traditional keyword search limitations:
- ❌ "personal budget" doesn't match "individual financial plan"
- ❌ "disability assistance" doesn't match "support for handicapped"
- ❌ "how to apply" doesn't match "application procedure"

Vector search solves this:
- ✅ Semantic similarity (meaning-based)
- ✅ Language-agnostic (multilingual)
- ✅ Context-aware
- ✅ Handles synonyms naturally
