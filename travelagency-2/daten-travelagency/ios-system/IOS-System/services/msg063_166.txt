### 2. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

Q&A system that:
1. Retrieves relevant documents (neural search)
2. Builds context
3. Generates answer (GPT)
4. Attributes sources

### 3. Cross-lingual Search

Search in one language, find results in others:
- Query: "Personal budget" (en)
- Translates to: "Persönliches Budget" (de), "Личный бюджет" (ru)
- Searches all languages
- Merges results

### 4. Smart Caching

Multi-level caching:
- Translation cache (Redis)
- Embedding cache
- Query result cache
- Token-based invalidation

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Ensemble Approach**: Multiple detection methods increased accuracy
2. **Hybrid Ranking**: Combined signals outperformed single methods
3. **Caching Strategy**: Reduced costs by 80%
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Users got value at each stage

### Challenges

1. **Model Size**: BERT models are large (1.3GB+)
   - Solution: Model quantization, GPU acceleration

2. **Translation Costs**: High volume = high costs
   - Solution: Aggressive caching, batch processing

3. **Language Detection**: Mixed-language text was tricky
   - Solution: Ensemble of detectors, script analysis

4. **Response Time**: Initial searches were slow
   - Solution: Caching, pre-indexing, optimization
