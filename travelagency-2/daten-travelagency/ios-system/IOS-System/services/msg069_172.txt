### 2. Circuit Breaker Placement

Use circuit breakers for:
- External API calls
- Database queries (if problematic)
- Long-running operations
- Third-party services

### 3. Load Balancing

- Use **Weighted** for servers with different capacities
- Use **Sticky Sessions** for stateful applications
- Use **Least Connections** for variable request times

### 4. Monitoring

Set up alerts for:
- Rate limit exceeded (>10% of users)
- Circuit breaker opens
- Backend health failures
- High error rates (>5%)
- Slow response times (p95 > 1s)
